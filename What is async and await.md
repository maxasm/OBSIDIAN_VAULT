The `async/await` syntax is a modern JavaScript feature that provides a more concise and readable way to work with asynchronous code. It is commonly used with Promises to handle asynchronous operations and make code appear more synchronous.

Here's a rundown of how `async/await` works:

1. `async` Function Declaration/Expression:
   - To use `await`, you need to define an `async` function by using the `async` keyword before the function declaration or expression.
   - An `async` function automatically returns a Promise.

2. `await` Keyword:
   - The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function.
   - It can be placed in front of a Promise-based asynchronous operation to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
   - When encountering an `await` expression, the function pauses, allowing other code to execute in the meantime.

3. Handling Promises:
   - When using `await`, the expression after it should be a Promise or an object with a `.then()` method.
   - If the Promise is resolved, the `await` expression returns the resolved value.
   - If the Promise is rejected, an exception is thrown, which can be caught using a `try/catch` block.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `async/await`:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```
