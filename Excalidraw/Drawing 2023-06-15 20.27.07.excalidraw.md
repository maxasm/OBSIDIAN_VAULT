# Text Elements
Transformers (Rewrite AI-Generated Content)

  ^U5oya76p

This AI content remover works on the basis of a "Transformer". A Transformer is a 
basic unit of sentence-transformation. e.g a there is a transformer for substituting 
words with synonyms. The following image basically describes how they work.
 ^lAgDik8b

AI Generated
Content ^2M2oDZQi

A Transformer which
changes only a particular
aspect of a sentence. ^cVftmjBI

New Text ^PGyfZaf0

The next text then goes through another
Transformer which transforms another aspect
of the same sentence. ^pbMBfwso

The idea is that, since each Transformer only transforms certain aspects of a sentence
leaving the remainder of the sentence un-modified, it will reduce the chance of the
sentence being flagged as AI-Generated.  ^wMVYsMjs

The following are the Transformers to use:

- Sentence Structure: This Transformer changes the sentence structure of the sentence.
                       Basically, it structures the sentence in a different way (easy).

- Synonyms           : This Transformer changes specific (words and phrase) just a few, to their 
                      synonyms. The synonym transformer can also take in the TONE in which to
                       rewrite the words or phrases. E.G -> Academic, Casual, Fun, etc.

                      : Create a dataset of catchy sentences that can be used as opening statements
                       and closing statements in an article, academic paper etc. 

- Focus               : Focus on a different aspect of the sentence. 

- Active to Passive   : Where applicable, this Transformer interchanges the voice of a sentence
                        without affecting much of the other attributes of the sentence.

- Accuracy             : An accuracy Transformer to ensure that all text is Grammartically accurate, 
                        i.e the correct grammar is used.

- Grammarly Shortening : Does the same thing as Grammarly shortening. (Including repetition)

- perplexity and burstiness : Do more research on this topic (Introduce some new words and phrases).

- List rewrite : Rewrites a list in a different way, order (Removing unnecessary words and phrases).

- Shorten and Extend      : Add or Remove content from the sentence.
 ^MCAdSNlJ

A transformer should also give you information on what changes it has made on a sentence.
This information will be used to inform the next transformer, not to change (or revert) the
changes of the previous transformer. E.g if the synonym transformer adds new words, they shouldn't
be removed by the next transformer. ^hejMHFVG

The editor should have an option to rewrite a particular sentence alone. Or other components of
the sentence such as words and clauses or rewrite using one of the prementioned transformers. ^xIP305LW

Add an option to select certain components of a sentence and write how you want it rewritten. Just like
Adobe's new feature of editing photos using text. ^sv5kvnzV
